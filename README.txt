To start the game you need to create your login.

Remember it, because every time you will use it to continue playing the game, as the game uses autosave.

In the first step, create your character. Choose your name, gender, house and your interrests in the wizarding universe. Don't worry, you can change that throughout the game freely.

Based on your interests a personalized plan will be created. You can edit it as you wish and you can also edit it throughout the game.

Next up is the actual game. In the top left corner there is a menu you can use however you need.

Other things are coming up...stay tuned!
