Welcome to Hogwarts Adventure, an exciting game that takes you on a personalized journey through the wizarding world of Harry Potter. In this game, you'll create your own character, choose your interests in the wizarding universe, and embark on an epic adventure filled with magic, mystery, and adventure.


Getting Started
===============
To start playing the game, you'll need to create your login. This login is important because it's how you'll access your saved game progress every time you play. Once you've created your login, you'll be able to start the game and begin your adventure.


Creating Your Character
=======================
The first step in the game is to create your character. You'll be able to choose your name, gender, house, and interests in the wizarding universe. Don't worry if you're not sure what to choose - you can always change your character's details later on in the game.

Based on your interests, a personalized plan will be created for you. You'll be able to edit this plan as you wish throughout the game, so you can customize your experience and make it truly your own.


Playing the Game
================
Once you've created your character and personalized your plan, you'll be ready to start playing the game. The game features short stories that are tailored to your plan and interests. In the top left corner of the screen, you'll find a menu that you can use to navigate through the game and access different features.

After watching all the stories, you'll need to answer a quiz and submit your answers. This will allow you to see how well you did and finish the game.


Autosave Feature
================
Open Door's Day at Hogwarts features an autosave feature that saves your progress automatically, so you don't have to worry about losing your progress if you need to take a break or exit the game. This means you can pick up right where you left off whenever you're ready to continue your adventure.


Last Words
==========
We hope you enjoy playing Hogwarts Adventure and experiencing the magic and wonder of the wizarding world. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.
