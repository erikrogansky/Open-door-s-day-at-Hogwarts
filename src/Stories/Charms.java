This spell allows you to levitate an object and move it around at your will. It requires a lot of <br> concentration and precise wand movements, but with practice, you'll be able to move even the heaviest objects with ease.<br>" +

This spell is also handy <br> if you want to impress your friends with some cool wand tricks.<br>" +
